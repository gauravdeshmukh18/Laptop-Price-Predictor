# Laptop-Price-Predictor
Building a regression model for prediction on Laptop Price Data set with model deployment

## Overview:
In this notebook, we are going to predict the purchasing amount of customize laptop, using various features such as Company, Screen Resolution, CPU, RAM, GPU, Operating System.
All the Data Science steps which required for the best predictions has been followed below from data collection to Mmdel deployment.

## Conclusion:
In this project, we tried to build a model using various algorithms such as Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, KNN regressor, Decision tree regressor, SVM regressor, Random forest regressor and XGB regressor to get the best possible prediction.
The Random Forest regressor gives us the best MAE value and r2 score for this problem.
